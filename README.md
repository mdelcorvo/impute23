# impute23

A Snakemake pipeline to prepare, annotate and eventually impute SNPs files from [23andMe](https://www.23andme.com/en-int/) genotyping platform.

- Input file is a tab separated file containing genotyping information of an individual:
```
# This data file generated by 23andMe
#
# Below is a text version of your data.  Fields are TAB-separated.
# Each line corresponds to a single SNP.  For each SNP, we provide its
# identifier, its location on a reference human genome, and the genotype call.
# Human genome reference used: GRCh37/Mito:rCRS

This file contains information about the genotype at 562,526 positions in an individualâ€™s genome. This kind of files are for example produced by the 23andMe genotyping analysis including the accession number of SNPs, its location information (chromosome, position), and the corresponding genotype.

Given this file with genotyping information the tasks are:
